# T3 Tots

Skills and helper scripts for [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code): thread status, waiting items, new threads, answers, reports, watches, and updates.

Private for now. [MIT](LICENSE). No accounts or telemetry; the only outbound send is optional `t3listen` to a webhook you set up.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `skills/` | One folder per skill. Start with `t3-getting-started`. Shared rules: `t3-tots-rules`. |
| `tools/` | Scripts, installed flat into one folder per computer. |
| `manifest.json` | Version, dest path, size, SHA-256, and which OS gets each file. |
| `scripts/`, `tests/` | Checks, manifest builder, skill sync. |

| Tool | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| `t3q.py` | all | Read-only T3 DB queries. No token. |
| `t3ctl` | all | Local API client and `skills` installer. `node t3ctl` prints usage. |
| `t3listen` | all | Optional. Pushes questions and run ends to your webhook. |
| `export.js`, `survey.js` | all | Redacted export and activity survey. |
| `t3ui` + `ui-*.applescript` | macOS | UI fallback if the local API is down (needs Accessibility). |
| `cleanup/scan.py` | all | Read-only disk-usage scan. |
| `cleanup/make_report.py`, `report/report.py` | Grok Bot box | HTML cleanup report and briefing. |
| `t3ctl.cmd`, `t3listen.cmd` | Windows | `cmd` wrappers; from PowerShell use `node t3ctl`. |

## Install

**Grok Bot.** Skills are built in. Say "set up T3 Tots"; after your yes it installs the tools on each computer.

**Other agents** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Hermes, …) need a signed-in `gh` while the repo is private. From an unpacked release:

```sh
gh release download -R Deepusleepy/t3-tots --archive tar.gz
tar xzf t3-tots-*.tar.gz && cd t3-tots-*/
node tools/t3ctl skills install --to ~/.claude/skills --dry-run
node tools/t3ctl skills install --to ~/.claude/skills
```

Windows: download `--archive zip`, expand, then `--to "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"`.

Skill folders: Claude Code `~/.claude/skills`, Codex `~/.agents/skills`, Cursor `~/.cursor/skills`, Hermes `~/.hermes/skills` (same paths under `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows). Install into one folder only. Cursor also loads the other three, so a second copy is listed twice.

Then ask the agent to set up T3 Tots. It follows [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (hash-check against `manifest.json`; Grok Bot-only steps: `t3-tots-rules` "Grok Bot only"). Updates use the same commands. Edited skills are kept unless you pass `--force` (old copy goes to `out/skills-backup/<timestamp>/`).

## Phone answers (optional)

`t3listen` POSTs live T3 events to a webhook you set up (`setup`, then `install` at login). Events: `request.opened` / `request.resolved`, and `thread.finished` / `failed` / `cancelled`. Approvals only if you turn them on. Usage-limit stops can arm T3's Resume at reset.

Setup, events, approvals, and autoresume: [t3-phone-answers](skills/t3-phone-answers/SKILL.md). Who may answer: [t3-tots-rules "Decisions"](skills/t3-tots-rules/SKILL.md).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** for `t3q.py` and `cleanup/scan.py` (3.9+ for `report/report.py`). Windows: `py -3`.
- **Node 22+** for `t3ctl` and `t3listen` (Node 18+ for `export.js` and `survey.js`).
- **T3 Code** installed and opened at least once.

## Security

- `t3q.py` opens `statev2.sqlite` read-only. From `server-runtime.json` it reads only `host`, `port` and `pid`.
- Scripts never open T3's `secrets/` or other credentials. The only token they read sits next to them, after your yes, 90-day TTL, never printed. Issue and revoke: [t3-tots-rules "Token"](skills/t3-tots-rules/SKILL.md).
- Traffic stays on `127.0.0.1` except optional `t3listen` POSTs to your webhook. Exports redact API-key patterns and your home path.
- No token: read-only. With one, `t3ctl answer` sends only the answer you chose. `t3ctl skills` writes only into `--to` and its own `out/`.

Report issues in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Developing

- `scripts/check.sh`. Syntax, tests, manifest freshness, CRLF on the Windows wrappers, private-word scan. Never-ship words go one per line in `~/.config/t3-tots/private-words.txt` (do not commit it). No list fails the check; `T3TOTS_NO_PRIVATE_WORDS=1` skips it on purpose.
- After changing a tool, add it to `TOOLS` in `scripts/make-manifest.py` and run that script. It rewrites `manifest.json` from `VERSION`.
- `scripts/sync-skills --from <folder>` (or `T3TOTS_SKILLS_SRC`) copies live skills into `skills/`, scans for private details, updates the manifest. Copies nothing if the scan fails.
- Release only from a tag. Installers download by tag and check every hash.
